Project Title: Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

Thank you for taking the time to review my Note Taker application and for your detailed feedback. I will make the necessary adjustments and resubmit the project based  on your invaluable feedback and notes. 

In this application you will be presented with a landing page with a link to the notes page when you first open the app. After clicking the link to the notes page, you will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, as well as empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column. When you enter a new note title and text, then a save icon will appear and you will be able to save your data, which will then be presented on the left-hand column. You will also be able to click on existing notes which will then be presented on the right side of the screen. Finally, when you click on the Write icon, you will be able to enter a new note title and new note text in the right-hand column. 

Thanks again!
